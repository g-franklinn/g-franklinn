I'm a brazilian full-stack ( mostly back-end ) developer. I study Controls and Automation Engineering at UFMG. I really enjoy learning about new languages and frameworks such as Python with Flask, and NodeJS. My main skills and what I like to work with is back-end developing making API's, data science and webscrapping.
